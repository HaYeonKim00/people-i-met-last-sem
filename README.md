# Interactive Bar Chart: Personal Meeting Data Analysis
This interactive design presents an analysis of personal meeting data extracted from my Google Calendar, spanning from August 2023 to December 2023. While there may have been additional lunch and dinner engagements, this visualization utilizes the data available on my Google Calendar.

### Overview
The x-axis displays the names of the individuals (note: not all entries are names, but a majority are), while the y-axis indicates the number of times I met with each person.

### Legend
In the top left corner of the visualization, there is a legend that categorizes the individuals based on certain criteria. Hovering over a legend item highlights the corresponding category in the chart with a distinct color. Additionally, when hovering over a legend item, the total number of meetings within that category is displayed.

### Technologies Used
p5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding and visualization, used to create the interactive bar chart.
